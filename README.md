Liri App
    -This app is essentially a very simplified Siri.
    -Liri can look up Songs on spotify, Concerts of a specific artist, and movies.
    -In addition to the 3 things listed above, it will log the input and the output of the search functions into the log.txt file.

Get started:
    -Make sure to get a spotify API key/secret and insert those values into a .env file in the root folder to be able to run the spotify function.
        -the txt file should look like this:
             # Spotify API keys

            SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
            SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret

-Load up the liri.js file in a terminal
    -Use these 4 commands:
        -spotify-this-song "enter song name here"
        -concert-this "enter artist name here"
        -movie-this "enter movie name here"
        -do-what-it-says (this will run whatever song name you have entered into the random.txt file.)
